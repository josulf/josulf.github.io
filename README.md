# Hi there!

This is Josu LÃ³pez, and this is my personal page where you can find some information about me, my projects and my interests.

## About me

I am a 34 year old guy who lives in Vitoria-Gasteiz. I have studied **Computer Engineering** and I have a master title in **Embedded Systems** at **UPV/EHU** in Donostia-San Sebastian.

After doing my Master's Thesis at the *Electronics* department of **IK4-Ikerlan** in Arrasate, related about the use of the *Xilinx ZYNQ* platform for real-time railway control systems, I worked there for 5 years as a **Research & Development Engineer** at the *Dependable Embedded Systems* department.

I used to work with any kind of *embedded systems*, starting from *little* DSPs to full-featured embedded processors, designing and developing **real-time** software for control systems used at sectors as elevation, traction or energy. I also get used to perform software testing with tools like *Mathworks Simulink*.

After that, I moved to **Matz-Erreka** in Bergara, a company that develops its own products. I started working at the **Service** department, assisting final users, technicians and internal workers about automatic sliding doors. Also, I provide trainings to local and international customers. After two years in that position, I moved to the **Product Development** department, developing products with the knowledge learned during the previous position. My duties are the design, development and testing of the embedded software for own products and also for special proyects for several customers.

I enjoy developing high-level applications, low-level BSPs or fighting against little but nasty bugs.

## Current situation

Recently, after spending 10 years working as a computers engineer, I have finished my job and I am studying to become a high school teacher. This idea was on my mind several time ago, so finally I have decided to take the step and to try to help other people transmiting my knowlegde.

I am very hopeful on that idea so I will work hard to achive it!

## My projects

At the moment I only have one relevant project here at GitHub. It is very simple Twitter client that worked on Texas Instruments Stellaris EKK-LM3S8962 Evaluation Kit. It was developed at an *Euskal Encounter 20* contest, in which I won the first price. You can get more information about it on its [website](https://github.com/josulf/Morsee). It does not currently work because the way it uses to authenticate with Twitter is not currently supported :(

## My interests

Apart from any gadget that has a blinking LED, my interests are playing sports like curling, basketball, bycicle or enduro riding, any book, movie or tv-show related to fantasy or specially sci-fi, cooking, playing board games with friends and recently designing and printing my own 3D designs.

I also have a little baby called Ibai who was born on October 2021, so now I spend the majority of my "free" time with my family ;)
