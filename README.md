# Hi there!

This is Josu LÃ³pez, and this is my personal page where you can find some information about me, my projects and my interests.

## About me

I am a 31 year old guy who lives in Vitoria-Gasteiz. I have studied **Computer Engineering** and I have a master title in **Embedded Systems** at **UPV/EHU** in Donostia-San Sebastian.

After doing my Master's Thesis at the *Electronics* department of **IK4-Ikerlan** in Arrasate, related about the use of the *Xilinx ZYNQ* platform for real-time railway control systems, I worked there for 5 years as a **Research & Development Engineer** at the *Dependable Embedded Systems* department.

I used to work with any kind of *embedded systems*, starting from *little* DSPs to full-featured embedded processors, designing and developing **real-time** software for control systems used at sectors as elevation, traction or energy. I also get used to perform software testing with tools like *Mathworks Simulink*.

After that, I moved to **Matz-Erreka** in Bergara, a company that develops its own products. I started working at the **Service** department, assisting final users, technicians and internal workers about automatic sliding doors. Also, I give them trainings to local and international customers. Recently I also started working at the **Product Development** department, developing products with the knowledge learned during the previous position.

I enjoy developing high-level applications, low-level BSPs or fighting against little but nasty bugs.

## My projects

At the moment I only have one relevant project here at GitHub. It is very simple Twitter client that worked on Texas Instruments Stellaris EKK-LM3S8962 Evaluation Kit. It was developed at an *Euskal Encounter 20* contest, in which I won the first price. You can get more information about it on its [website](https://github.com/josulf/Morsee). It does not currently work because the way it uses to authenticate with Twitter is not currently supported :(

## My interests

Apart from any gadget that has a blinking LED, my interests are playing sports like curling, basketball, bycicle or enduro riding, any book, movie or tv-show related to fantasy or specially sci-fi, cooking, playing board games with friends and recently designing and printing my own 3D designs.
