# Hi there!

This is Josu LÃ³pez, and this is my personal page where you can find some information about me, my projects and my interests.

## About me

I am a 29 year old guy who lives in Vitoria-Gasteiz. I have studied **Computer Engineering** and I have a master title in **Embedded Systems** at **UPV/EHU** in Donostia-San Sebastian.

After doing my Master's Thesis at the *Electronics* department of **IK4-Ikerlan** in Arrasate, related about the use of the *Xilinx ZYNQ* platform for real-time railway control systems, I am currently working there as a **Research & Development Engineer** at the *Dependable Embedded Systems* department.

I work with any kind of *embedded systems*, starting from *little* DSPs to full-featured embedded processors, designing and developing **real-time** software for control systems used at sectors as elevation, traction or energy. I also get used to perform software testing with tools like *Mathworks Simulink*.

I enjoy developing high-level applications, low-level BSPs or fighting against little but nasty bugs.

## My projects

At the moment I only have one relevant project here at GitHub. It is very simple Twitter client that worked on Texas Instruments Stellaris EKK-LM3S8962 Evaluation Kit. It was developed at an *Euskal Encounter 20* contest, in which I won the first price. You can get more information about it on its [website](https://github.com/josulf/Morsee). It does not currently work because the way it uses to authenticate with Twitter is not currently supported :(

## My interests

Apart from any gadget that has a blinking LED, my interests are bycicle, enduro riding, sci-fi, cooking, mountain or board games.
